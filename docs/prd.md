- **Cross-Browser**: Chrome, Edge, Safari compatibility for maximum workstation flexibility

## Technical Assumptions

### CRITICAL: System Boundaries and Non-Interactions

**PK App Scope (What We Build):**
- **Location**: `/PK/` folder - completely standalone application
- **Tables**: ONLY Cust_PartialRun, cust_PartialPicked, Cust_PartialLotPicked, Cust_PartialPalletLotPicked tables + shared LotMaster/LotTransaction updates
- **Technology**: Angular 20 + Rust + C# bridge service (NEW implementation)
- **Purpose**: Partial picking with weight scale integration ONLY

**Reference Systems (What We DON'T Touch):**
- **Webserver (PHP)**: Used for run creation only - we READ from Cust_PartialRun table (primary keys: RunNo, RowNum), don't modify
- **Mobile-Rust**: Bulk picking system - used as reference for patterns/workflows, NO direct interaction
- **Database Interaction**: PK app does NOT touch any Cust_Bulk* tables or Mobile-Rust code

**Shared Database Tables (Coordination Required):**
- **LotMaster**: Inventory updates (QtyCommitSales) - shared with all picking systems
- **LotTransaction**: Audit trail records - shared audit pattern compliance
- **TFCPILOT3**: Single database, multiple applications accessing different table sets

### Repository Structure: Standalone
PK app lives in `/PK/` folder as completely independent Angular-Rust application following Mobile-Rust structural patterns but with NO code dependencies or direct integrations.

### Service Architecture
**Standalone Web Application**: Angular + Rust + C# bridge service architecture inspired by Mobile-Rust patterns but implemented from scratch for partial picking requirements with weight scale hardware integration.

### Testing Requirements
**Full Testing Pyramid**: Unit testing for Rust backend services, integration testing for database transactions, E2E testing with Playwright for user workflows, and manual testing convenience methods for weight scale hardware validation. Critical focus on transaction integrity testing for 5-table partial picking workflow.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Database Configuration:**
- **Dual Database Dependencies**:
  - TFCLIVE: Required by ScaleLibrary.dll (hardcoded) for scale configuration
  - TFCPILOT3: Primary database for partial picking operations (configurable via .env)
  - INMAST table: ItemKey tolerance values (USER8/USER9) - determine database location
- **NO HARDCODED NAMES**: Application database name MUST be configurable via PRIMARY_DB environment variable, never hardcode TFCPILOT3 in code
- **SQL Server MCP Integration**: Use sqlserver MCP to verify actual database schemas and table structures during development
- **Schema Verification**: All table field names, data types, and primary keys must match actual SQL Server schema exactly (case-sensitive)
- **Scale Configuration**: ScaleLibrary.dll requires TFCLIVE access (cannot be changed)
- **Tolerance Integration**: INMAST.USER8/USER9 fields must be accessible for business validation
- **Environment Control**: All configurable database connections via .env files following Mobile-Rust patterns

**Technology Stack Decisions:**
- **Frontend**: Angular 20 + TypeScript + Modern CSS architecture with NWFTH component system
- **Backend**: Rust + Axum framework + Tiberius SQL Server driver (matching Mobile-Rust exactly)
- **Weight Scale Integration**: C# bridge service using ScaleLibrary.dll with HTTP/WebSocket API
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server TFCPILOT3 unified architecture
- **Authentication**: SQL Server tbl.user + LDAP integration (Mobile-Rust pattern)

**Performance and Scalability:**
- **Connection Pooling**: Rust backend database connection pooling for concurrent workstation support
- **WebSocket Architecture**: Real-time weight updates using Axum WebSocket handlers
- **Caching Strategy**: In-memory caching for workstation configuration and scale settings
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with workstation-specific session tracking

**Development and Deployment:**
- **Build System**: npm run dev:all for unified frontend/backend development (Mobile-Rust pattern)
- **Environment Configuration**: .env files for database connections, LDAP settings, scale configurations
- **Schema Verification Tools**: Use SQL Server MCP during development to verify field names, types, and constraints match actual database
- **Code Standards**: cargo clippy for Rust, Angular ESLint for TypeScript, consistent with Mobile-Rust
- **Version Control**: Professional commit messages without AI signatures (Mobile-Rust standard)

**Security and Compliance:**
- **Network Security**: Local C# bridge service HTTP API (localhost only) for scale communication
- **Database Security**: Parameterized queries with Tiberius driver, same patterns as Mobile-Rust
- **User Authentication**: Existing LDAP integration with SQL Server user management
- **Scale Data Validation**: Input sanitization for all weight readings and tolerance values

**Hardware Integration:**
- **Multi-Scale Support**: C# bridge service handles multiple COM port configurations (COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5) simultaneously across different scale types and capacities
- **USB Auto-Detection**: Automatic detection and registration of newly connected weight scales using Windows WMI events
- **Dynamic Scale Registration**: Plug-and-play scale setup with automatic database insertion into TFC_Weighup_Controllers and TFC_Weighup_WorkStations tables
- **COM Port Management**: C# bridge service handles SerialPort connections via ScaleLibrary.dll with automatic COM port discovery
- **Auto-Configuration**: Workstation detection via CLIENTNAME/COMPUTERNAME environment variables with automatic scale-to-workstation mapping
- **Scale Protocol**: "P" command polling every 400ms for real-time weight readings across all connected scales
- **Scale Selection Logic**: Users can select appropriate scale type based on ingredient weight requirements (high-capacity, medium-capacity, precision scales)
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection handling for scale communication failures with scale failover capabilities

## Actual Transaction Analysis Documentation

Based on comprehensive analysis of real partial picking operations (Run 6000028 and Run 600015), the following transaction pattern has been confirmed:

### 5-Table Atomic Transaction Pattern

**STEP 1: cust_PartialPicked UPDATE**
```sql
UPDATE cust_PartialPicked
SET PickedPartialQty = @weight_from_scale,      -- Uses this field, NOT PickedPartialQtyKG!
    PickingDate = @timestamp,
    ItemBatchStatus = 'Allocated',
    ModifiedBy = @user_id,
    ModifiedDate = @timestamp
WHERE RunNo = @run_no AND RowNum = @row_num AND LineId = @line_id
```

**STEP 2: Cust_PartialLotPicked INSERT**
```sql
INSERT INTO Cust_PartialLotPicked (
    RunNo, RowNum, BatchNo, LineId, LotNo, ItemKey, LocationKey,
    DateReceived, DateExpiry, TransactionType, QtyReceived,
    AllocLotQty, QtyUsed, BinNo, User11, LotStatus, RecUserid, RecDate
) VALUES (
    @run_no, @row_num, @batch_no, @line_id, @selected_lot, @item_key, @location,
    @timestamp, @lot_expiry, 5, @picked_qty,
    @picked_qty, @picked_qty, @source_bin, 1, 'Allocated', @user_id, @timestamp
)
```

**STEP 3: LotMaster UPDATE**
```sql
UPDATE LotMaster
SET QtyCommitSales = QtyCommitSales + @picked_qty
WHERE LotNo = @selected_lot AND ItemKey = @item_key AND BinNo = @source_bin
```

**STEP 4: LotTransaction INSERT**
```sql
INSERT INTO LotTransaction (
    LotNo, ItemKey, LocationKey, DateExpiry, TransactionType,
    ReceiptDocNo, ReceiptDocLineNo, IssueDocNo, IssueDocLineNo,
    IssueDate, QtyIssued, RecUserid, RecDate, BinNo, User5
) VALUES (
    @selected_lot, @item_key, @location, @lot_expiry, 5,
    @bt_document, 1, @batch_no, 1,
    @timestamp, @picked_qty, @user_id, @timestamp, @source_bin, 'Picking Customization'
)
```

**STEP 5: Cust_PartialPalletLotPicked INSERT**
```sql
INSERT INTO Cust_PartialPalletLotPicked (
    RunNo, RowNum, BatchNo, LineId, PalletID, RecUserid, RecDate
) VALUES (
    @run_no, @row_num, @batch_no, @line_id, @pallet_id, @user_id, @timestamp
)
```

### Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Field Usage**: Always use `PickedPartialQty` in cust_PartialPicked with composite primary key (RunNo, RowNum, LineId), never use `PickedPartialQtyKG`
2. **Lot Selection**: System uses FEFO (First Expired, First Out) logic
3. **Document Generation**: Auto-generates BT document numbers for audit trail
4. **Allergen Handling**: Preserve allergen codes (e.g., "D" for dairy) in Allergen field
5. **User Tracking**: Consistent user ID format across all tables
6. **TransactionType**: Always use 5 for partial picking operations
7. **Timing**: Individual pick timestamps with batch completion processing

### Validated Database Schema

**Key Columns That Are Updated:**
- cust_PartialPicked: `PickedPartialQty` (decimal 18,6), `PickingDate`, `ItemBatchStatus`, `ModifiedBy`, `ModifiedDate` with composite primary key (RunNo, RowNum, LineId)
- Cust_PartialLotPicked: LotTranNo (bigint identity) primary key, all fields per verified SQL schema
- LotMaster: `QtyCommitSales` (decimal 18,6) incremented with exact precision
- LotTransaction: Complete audit record with proper TranType and BT document reference
- Cust_PartialPalletLotPicked: Pallet tracking with verified schema field names and types

**Key Columns That Remain NULL:**
- cust_PartialPicked: `ToPickedPartialQtyKG`, `PickedPartialQtyKG` (legacy unused fields - use PickedPartialQty with proper decimal 18,6 precision)
- Most User1-User12 fields across tables (except specific flags like User11=1)

This transaction analysis ensures 100% compatibility with the existing partial picking system and provides the exact specifications needed for the Angular-Rust implementation.
